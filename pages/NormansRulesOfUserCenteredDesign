Donald A. Norman, author of <u>The Design Of Everyday Things</u>, wrote that the
point of his writing the book was to "...advocate a user-centered design, a
philosophy based on the needs and interests of the user, with an emphasis
on making products usable and understandable." He continued:

<blockquote>"Design should:

- Make it easy to determine what actions are possible at any moment
  (make use of constraints).
- Make things visible, including the conceptual model of the system,
  the alternative actions, and the results of actions.
- Make it easy to evaluate the current state of the system.
- Follow natural mappings between intentions and the required ac-
  tions; between actions and the resulting effect; and between the
  information that is visible and the interpretation of the system state.

In other words, make sure that (1) the user can figure out what to do,
and (2) the user can tell what is going on.
     Design should make use of the natural properties of people and of
the world: it should exploit natural relationships and natural con-
straints. As much as possible, it should operate without instructions or
labels. Any necessary instruction or training should be needed only
once; with each explanation the person should be able to say, `Of
course,' or `Yes, I see.' A simple explanation will suffice if there is
reason to the design, if everything has its place and its function, and
if the outcomes of the actions are visible. If the explanation leads the
person to think or say, `How am I going to remember that?' the design
has failed."</blockquote>

I hope that the implementation of <tt>sk</tt> is an embodiment of these principles. (See
also HowSimpleIsSK.)
