<h1>What is a Wiki Word?</h1>
A "wiki word" is a word that follows these formatting rules:
1. it consists of only letters;
2. it must begin with a capital letter;
3. it may have one or more small letters;
4. it must also have at least one other capital letter.

Surprisingly, acronyms (like HTML) end up being wiki words with this definition.
<strike>(However, since the "special formatting" language for <tt>sk</tt> is HTML itself, you
can hack this "feature" by inserting a &lt;N<nobr>O</nobr><nobr>B</nobr>R&gt; element between capital letters.

(That doesn't work so well in Firefox/Mozilla....)

Some examples are:
- WhatIsAWikiWord
- AreWeThereYet
- ABC

And some non-examples are:
- abc (it has no capital letters)
- Abc (it has only one capital letter)
- haveSomething (only one capital, and not at the beginning)
- Something4Me (has a number)
- Something-To-See (has punctuation)

Another way to think of a "wiki word" is that it is like a phrase of words,
and each of the words is smushed together without spaces. Then the
first letter of each word is capitalized so that as you read the word you
can distinguish its parts.
