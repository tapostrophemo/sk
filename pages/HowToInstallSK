<h1>How to install <tt>sk</tt></h1>
1. Download the most recent version of the code (DownloadSK) and unzip
    the files to a temporary directory.

2. Create two directories, one for your wiki pages, and one that <tt>sk</tt> will
    use to store operational data; ensure that <tt>sk</tt> will have read/write/create
    access to these directories.

3. Make configuration changes to the <tt>sk.pl</tt> source file to specify your "pages"
    and "data" directories (see comments in SkConfiguration and the source).

4. Move/copy the configured <tt>sk.pl</tt> source file to the directory on your
    web server where it executes Perl scripts (e.g., <tt>cgi-bin/</tt>).

5. Move the JavaScript, CSS, and PNG files to an appropriate location
    on your server.

6. Move other files as desired (e.g., the "pages" files in the distribution) if
    you want them on your site.

<b>Windows notes</b>:
- Ensure that the first line in the file reads:
  <tt>#!/usr/bin/perl -wT</tt>
  or possibly
  <tt>#!/usr/bin/perl -w</tt>
  (see below; under some conditions you won't want the final "T")
- If you need a Perl and Apache installation on your machine, you might
  try IndigoPerl (<a href="http://www.indigostar.com">www.indigostar.com</a>)
- If you're running under IIS, you'll probably have to turn taint checking off
  (i.e., the shebang line should read <tt>#!perl -w</tt> instead of <tt>#!perl -wT</tt>)
- Google for the system configuration settings you might need to make (or
  request from your sysadmin) to get IIS (or even PWS) to recognize and
  execute Perl scripts

<b>*nix notes</b>; following the general instructions above, you'll also need to:
- replace the Windows "shebang" line (<tt>#!perl -wT</tt>) in the source with a
  Unix-y one (<tt>#!/usr/bin/perl -wT</tt>)
- <tt>chown</tt> and/or <tt>chgrp</tt> the $DATA_DIR and $PAGE_DIR directories
  so that the webserver process can write to them
