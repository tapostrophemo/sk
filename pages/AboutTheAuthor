<h1>Dan Parks</h1>
By day a Java developer at an auto insurance company.

By night a sometimes-musician, occasional artist, and Perl hacker.
And although he's used a variety of programming languages in the
course of his employment, he holds Perl, Smalltalk and JavaScript in
the highest regard. Though he hasn't tried Python and Ruby yet, he
suspects that they would also earn his respect.

(In other words, he doesn't get enough sleep. And PHP, when used
with <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com">Code Igniter</a>, isn't bad.)

At all times he is the father of Sam and Emily and the spouse of Sarah.
<strike>They have no pets. </strike> They have no large pets (they do have a gerbil).
(They have no fence.)
