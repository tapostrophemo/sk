<b>Motivation</b>

<tt>sk</tt> is so simple that:

- I wrote it in one night (and added enhancements over the next few days,
  but it still didn't take long)
- it uses filesystem-level storage; no need for a database
- it can run on a variety of platforms - Windows and Apache, Windows and
  IIS, Linux and Apache are all environments under which I've run and developed
  <tt>sk</tt>; see also HowToInstallSK
- it has no special formatting; what you see (or type) is what you get
- it doesn't allow for any special internal liking, other than "wiki words"
  (see WhatIsAWikiWord)
- you can't upload images to it; it's only text
- it provides minimal functionality; viewing pages, editing pages, and
  saving pages (there's no cancel button! you can't delete pages (well
  you can, if you're the sysadmin))
- when considering how to add versioning/history functionality, I decided
  against it

(Coincidently, I was reading Donald A. Norman's <u>The Design of Everyday Things</u>
about the same time I created <tt>sk</tt>.)

<b>Arguments</b>

<dl><dt>It's too simple...why did you make it so simple?</dt><dd>
1. I hate learning a new formatting language for each new wiki I encounter
2. I already know HTML (as do lots of other people); why shouldn't I use it
    as my markup/formatting language?</dd>

<dt>But what if you want to format things to look nice?</dt><dd>
- Use HTML; the code is also so simple that it doesn't <em>disallow</em> its use.
- And use line breaks.
- Tweak the CSS.
- Note that the contents of every page are displayed inside a &lt;P<nobr>R</nobr>E&gt; element.</dd>

<dt>What if you want "safe" version control so you can put the wiki in a highly
volitaile environment that allows anybody to edit it?</dt><dd>
- Get CVS
- Get a journaling filesystem
- Tweak the code</dd>

<dt>People don't like HTML in wikis - it's unsafe (JavaScript) or interrupts the flow of
writing (http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?WhyDoesntWikiDoHtml)</dt><dd>
I don't agree, at least as far as my own uses of <tt>sk</tt>. I do understand that some
of you out there might have other requirements, though.</dd></dl>

Recently I discovered a few other "<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?PersonalWiki">simple</a>" wikis. In fact, I wrote this wiki
after reading through <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?NoteWiki">NoteWiki's</a> code (the prettiest VB I've ever seen!).

Anyway, <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/01/06/a-simple-wiki-with-webpy/">this</a> is is one built in Python. I need to try it out.
