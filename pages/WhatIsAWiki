<h1>What is a wiki?</h1>
A wiki is a flexible, user-created website.

It is navigated by clicking on specially-formatted "wiki words" (see
WhatIsAWikiWord). These words are turned into hyperlinks.

Note that (with few exceptions), you can edit any page by simply clicking
the "edit" link that appears on the page. (This wiki allows the operator to
disable editing, however.)

To create a new page in the wiki, simply enter your own "wiki word" and
save the page. When the screen refreshes, you can then click on the link
for the new wiki word, and if a page with the same name does not already
exist, you will be taken to a new screen containing an empty text box.
Type whatever you want in the box, then save your new page!

The "original" wiki is probably <a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki">http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki</a>. Everything else
was (and is, and probably will ever be) an imitation.
