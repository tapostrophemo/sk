(I'll only put these in if I really need them...probably YAGNI)

<b>General</b>
- Some clever JavaScript to make the textbox resizable (in development; I've put
  a rudimentary version in 0.2.7.*, but it still needs tweaking in order to 1) look
  good, and 2) behave the same in multiple browsers - I'm targeting IE and Firefox)
- Make the wiki-word links for pages that don't exist have a '?' following them
  (instead of just making them regular hyperlinks)
- Create an "installer" program
- Page versions/history (see ImplementingPageVersioning)
- Pick a license
- Shortcut key for "Save" button?
- Backlinks (and somewhat relatedly, find orphan pages)
- use IO::All (http://search.cpan.org/~ingy/IO-All-0.35/lib/IO/All.pod) instead
  of what I currently am using (IO::File)

<b>Security</b>
- On Windows (at least NT; I'll have to try 98/2000/XP), 246 is max
  filename length; I should also check on Linux or other operating
  systems, and enfore the value in the code

  Oooooh! It gets even better (or worse)! You can create a file with a
  name 246 characters long, but then you can't rename/delete that file!!!

  Well, I can delete it from a command prompt. Anyway, just to
  simplify things (remember DTSTTCPW) I might just limit it to 240 or
  something...or, in the name of YAGNI, I might not.

<b>"Technical debt"</b>
- You saw the lack of unit tests? Shame on me! (By the way, when I tried to just
  split the packages out into a separate file I realized that there's a lot of
  dependencies between classes...)
