<h1>How to configure your deployment of <tt>sk</tt></h1>
(This will be useful mostly to system administrators.)

These and other variables are defined near the top of <tt>sk.pl</tt>, and will
determine some of the behaviors of <tt>sk</tt>. Most of the others are self-
explanatory, but I thought these deserved extra attention:

- <tt>$IS_EDITABLE</tt> - when set to a non-zero/defined value, the wiki will
  allow users to edit and create pages.

- <tt>$MAX_PAGE_SIZE</tt> - the maximum allowable approximate* size (in bytes)
  for the wiki-pages on your site. I write "approximate" because this is
  assigned to <tt>$C<nobr><tt>G</tt></nobr>I::POST_MAX</tt>, which will limit the entire POST size, including
  the name of the page you're creating/editing, so the actual allowable
  page size will be slightly smaller.

  By default this is set to 800K, which, given that the wiki pages themselves
  are simple text files, ought to be sufficient for many sites. If it turns out to
  not be enough, adjust the number up accordingly.
