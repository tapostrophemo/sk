DTSTTCPW - Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.

Just what it says.

By the way, implementing page versioning/history is not a "simple thing".
I wanted to implement this wiki under certain constraints (no Perl modules
that aren't in the "core", no databases, flexibility to run on almost any
webserver where Perl is also installed, etc.), and when faced with a design
decision, would try to adhere to this principle.

However, I might reconsider the page history thing...I think users might get
upset if they spent lots of time working on the wiki, and then everything
were just deleted.
